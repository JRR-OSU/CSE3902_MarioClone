The code is definitely in high quality. Some lines of codes that difficult to understand
are accompanied with the comments. The code has a clear structure, looks clean and tidy.

Again, I think I am not able to make further improvements to this code. I do not have
experience in writing camera code. In my perspective, the camera is implemented in the 
simplest way, there is no extra part. I will continue to learn from Tim's code.
