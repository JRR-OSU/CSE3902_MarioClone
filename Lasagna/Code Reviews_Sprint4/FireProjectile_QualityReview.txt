Sprint 4
FireProjectile.cs

The code is definitely in high quality. Only few necessary methods are overridden. The
Update() methods handled the movement of fireball perfectly. It performs like the original
game during the testing. The collision response parts also follow the original game rules.

I am not able to make further modifications. Because I am not able to handle the gravity
in the game well. I still need to learn from the code, and implement the concepts in the
future sprints.
