The code is readable and easy to understand. My only suggestion would be to replace the logic for the HUD with one singular component that
handles the logic for each different HUDs, instead of having each HUD interface in some way with the MarioGame class. Tim's implementation
of the HUD interface helped significantly with this, however more would be needed to increase abstraction.
