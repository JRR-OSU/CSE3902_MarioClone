The code looks great at this time. The methods are well defined,
and the method bodies are not long, it is easy to understand how
the method works. For the CanSeeCollider method, the return statement
saved lines of codes and I like it. In my perspective, the code is
nearly perfect and I cannot think of a way to improve it.
