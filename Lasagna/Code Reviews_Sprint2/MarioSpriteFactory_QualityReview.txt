This file of codes is in high cohesion and low coupling. For instance, the fields follow correct naming formats, 
easy to know what are they used for. One load method can be used to load all the needed content in just one call.
Other object types are well defined, strictly follow the object-oriented programming principles, do not have extra
part of code. It is a good example for me to learn to write high quality codes.

Again, I think I am not able to do further improvements to the codes. Hope that after the growth of my programming
ability, I can finish more improvements.
