Overall the methods and fields are clearly named. 

The MarioStateMachine being in the same class as Mario is a bit confusing though, 
I believe that should be split out into its own class.

There are also a large number of if-else statements which make the MarioStateMachine class hard to read, 
finding a way to use less branching logic would be good.
