Sprint 2
AnimatedSprite.cs
Timothy Williams

Codes strictly follow the object-oriented programming principles,  there is no extra unuseful part,
some methods are explained by the comments. Additionally, the author even add the fps parameters for the animated
sprites, which allows us to change the animation speed of sprites. It is obvious that the codes are in high quality,
much better than the standard of a normal student. I hope that I can learn from the code he will write in 
this semester.

To be honest, it is really hard for me to think of an improvement on this part of the code. I was not able to write
the code like this.
