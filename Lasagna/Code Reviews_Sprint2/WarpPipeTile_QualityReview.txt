There are some comments explaining that each integer number represents what kind of state. Try to initialize final int variables like "final int hasFlower = 1;", so this kind of comments will 
not be necessary, or the comments will become long and verbose after furture states are added.
The original state should be NotHaveFlower because whatever you want to have a flower at the tip of the pipe or not, you all need to create a pipe which does not have flower. If you want to
have a flower, call changeState and spawn a flower at the tip of the pipe.
