Fields and methods are still appropriately and readably named. 

Logic is simple and very easy to understand. The use of the abstract class allows this class to be more readable. The Dictionary is defined readably as well.

The only thing I would say is perhaps harder to understand is the use of base: in the constructor, however this just extends from the now-implemented abstract class, which overall improves readability.
