CollisionDetection.cs
Timothy Williams

Code generally looks good, everything except the collision on the invisible tile work fine. Code looks a little
complicated at this time. Some lines of code are repeated. For instance, some lines in Update() method are very
similar to the lines of code in CheckRectCollision(). It is definitely a good code, at least I am not able to
handle collision detection part at this time.

I think maybe there is a way to call CheckRectCollision() in the Update() method, thus, we make the Update()
method look tidy and clean. Except this part, in my perspective, I think no more improvement can be made.
