MouseController.cs
Timothy Williams

The code looks good. It is a good choice that the code does not inherit from IController,
because there are so many methods that not needed in the mouse controller part. Thus, 
without inheritance, the code is still in high cohesion and low coupling.

I think I cannot come up with an idea to improve this code, because it looks good for me.
There is no extra part, and the editor used the simplest way to implement the code. It is
a good example to learn how to write high quality code.
