MouseController.cs

The code looks completely readable to me. All the methods are well defined, all the variables names
are easy to understand. It is easy for a user to distinguish the functions of each variable and
methods even without the comments. So although there are few comments in this code, it is still
easy to understand. For instance, for the ToggleMouseController() method, it must be used to enable
or disable mouse.
