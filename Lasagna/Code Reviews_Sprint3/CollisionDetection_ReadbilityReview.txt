The code generally looks good. Only some method headers look similar. For instance, the CheckCollisions()
and CheckRectCollisions(), maybe those can be renamed into a better way. It seems that overlap Rectangle
is not used after the definition of it. As what I talked about in the quality review, if the Update() is
simplified, then the code will be more readable than the current code.
