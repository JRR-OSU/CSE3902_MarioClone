The code is decent. The coin spawning problem was fixed. I thought it was the 
problem in LevelCreator, but it is not. And the code quality was improved by
the elimination of magic numbers.

As what I metioned at last time, maybe the items can be passed into a list,
even if the number of items is 1 or 0. However, this might comsume more
memory and run time, but the code can be simplified in this way.
