The code is decent. Methods headers are easy to understand. However, some methods
are too long, which is not easy for code reading. For instance, for
TryCreateTileFromEnum, there are too many lines in this method. I think a better way
to solve this problem is to break it dowm into several parts, write them into 
different methods, so it will be more readable.
