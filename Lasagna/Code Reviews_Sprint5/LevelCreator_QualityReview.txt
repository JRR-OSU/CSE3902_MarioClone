The code is decent. However, it has problems when generating coins in the block.
The coin will be generated at a wrong place. A temporary fix made the code become
much longer. Also for the passing items into the tiles, I think there is still 
some space for improving.

For instance, the code can always pass a item list into the tile, regardless how
many items need to be passed into one tile. The tile*.cs will detect the item list
length by itself, and take the items[0] by default. By using this improvement,
it can eliminate the code of passing one item into one tile.
