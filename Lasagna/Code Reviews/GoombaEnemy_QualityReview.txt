Consider a little separation in the fields to separate the groups of variables, i.e., ISprites and bools...etc. 

This source file is very well written and accomplishes the goal very simply and directly. The logic can be slightly simplified in the update method by just saying if(this.liveState). 

Everything looks and functions great.
