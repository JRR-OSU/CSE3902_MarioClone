GoombaEnemy.cs - Refactored Implementation
Yiwei Zhang
5 minutes

This source file accomplishes everything it needs to, and after being refactored it is significantly more reusable. 

The use now of the enum increases single point control over change, as does the ChangeState method. The use of the abstract class reduces clutter and increases cohesion. 

Lastly the use of the dictionary allows for more organization of initialized sprites. Quality of this file has increased significantly after refactoring.
